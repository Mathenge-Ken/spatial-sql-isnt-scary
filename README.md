# spatial-sql-isnt-scary
Spatial SQL offers the ability to work with vector- and raster-based geospatial data using the lingua franca of the database world, Structured Query Language (SQL). When combining a relational database management system (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL with PostGIS, its spatial extension, users have the ability to perform a seemingly endless list of spatial functions – as one prominent developer likes to say, it is literally a “GIS in a box.” Geared for introductory users, this webinar will introduce participants to basic SQL queries, some common spatial queries using PostGIS, and how this technology is incorporated into QGIS.

The queries in this repo were used during the webinar and can be used as a quick reference when learning PostGIS. 

The data used during the webinar is all from the Windsor, Ontario open data portal: https://opendata.citywindsor.ca/

The video of the webinar on April 7, 2022 is available here: https://youtu.be/V9rwY86rMKQ
